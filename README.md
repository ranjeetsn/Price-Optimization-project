# Coffee chain Retail price optimization project

Introduction
Pricing a product is a crucial aspect of any business. This project focuses on identifying the optimal prices for items in a cafe based on their past sales and price elasticity. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon RDS and analyzed using various machine learning algorithms in Python.

## Project Overview

This project involves:

Calculating Price Elasticity: Determine the price elasticity for each item using historical sales data.
Optimizing Prices: Use the calculated price elasticity to figure out the optimal price for each item.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Process and analyze the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Apply regression trees and ordinary least squares methods to estimate price elasticity and optimize prices.

## Dataset
The data for this project is contained in three CSV files:

Cafe - Sell MetaData.csv: Details about sales made by the cafe.

Columns: Sell ID, Sell Category, Item ID, Item Name
Cafe - Transaction - Store.csv: Information about transactions and sale receipts of the cafe.

Columns: Calendar Date, Price, Quantity, Sell ID, Sell Category
Cafe - DateInfo.csv: Date information corresponding to the transactions performed.

Columns: Date, Year, Holiday, Weekend, School Break, Temperature, Outdoor

## Tools and Techniques

### Techniques
Price Optimization Algorithms
Cost-less Pricing
Competition-based Pricing
Perceived Value Pricing
Demand-based Pricing

### Tools
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Cleaning: Remove redundancy and ensure consistency.
Data Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
Data Merging: Merge datasets using Pandas dataframes.
